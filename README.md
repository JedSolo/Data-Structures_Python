# Data-Structures_Python

Include working python codes for the following data structures:
1. Linked List
2. Doubly Linked Lists
3. Linear Search
4. Binary Search
5. Queues
6. Stacks

### Common operations on linked list:
1. Adding nodes
2. Removing nodes
3. Finding a node
4. traversing (or travelling through) the linked list

### Common operations on  doubly linked list:
1. Adding nodes to both ends of the list
2. Removing nodes from both ends of the list
3. Finding and removing a node from anywhere in the list
4. Traversing (or travelling through) the list.

### Common operations on Queues:
1. Enqueue - adds data to the 'back' or end of the queue
2. Dequeue - provide and removes data from the "front" or begining of the queue
3. Peek - reveals data from the 'front' of the queue without removing it 

### Common operations on Stacks:
1. Push - adds data to the 'top' of the stack
2. Pop - returns and removes data from the 'top' of the stack
3. Peek - returns data from the "top" of the stack without removing it.
